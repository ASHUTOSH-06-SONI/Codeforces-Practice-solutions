Heyy,
This is an open repository of the questions i've been doing in codeforces to get started.
I'm saving this repository for the starters (im a starter too as of now lol) 
so some random day when i'm prolly a candidate master, I'll make this readme file more decorated
The codes are in C/C++ (mostly cpp) 
I want to try it out in python,go,java or rust (heckk even assembly) but that'll be some day else
